# Go_NoGo_Data_Do

## 3 Scripts
### 1. Data Clean-up
Consolidate data from individual spreadsheets into one
- Remove practice files; keep large task files only
- Combine task versions into one dataset
- Delete unnecessary columns; keep only required variables
- Filter to keep only “P Trials” and “R Trials”
- Mark trials as incorrect where reaction time <120ms
- Calculate incorrect trials per participant
- Flag participants with >25% incorrect trials for exclusion
- Report excluded participants

### 3. Data Analysis
- Calculate the total accuracy rate, 
- Calculate the number of hits,  
- Calculate the omission errors. 
- Calculate the commission errors. 
- Calculate the rejections to the no go letter (e.g., true negatives)
- Calculate the errors due to reaction time being <120 ms
- Repeat Steps 1-6 for parts 1 and 2 of the task separately
- Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of participant reaction times
- Consolidating the data

### 4. 2-in-1 Clean & Analyse Raw Data files
